Lindsell\nKing’s Bench 1B \u0026amp; Ald 681 (1818)\nIn this case the plaintiff Adams was an English wool manufacturer, and the defendant Lindsell was a German wool distributor. The background to the controversy in the case was that on 2 September 1817 the defendant Lindsell made an offer by letter to sell a certain quantity of wool to the plaintiff Adams and specified that the plaintiff was required to give him an answer by post. But the letter did not reach the plaintiff in time, owing to the defendant\u0026rsquo;s wrong address. The plaintiff received the letter on the 5th of September and on the same day undertook the offer and sent the letter back, and on the 9th of September the defendant received the letter, but he had already sold the wool to a third party on the 8th of September.\nOn this point the plaintiff and the defendant held different propositions. Adams, the plaintiff, contended that he had accepted the offer as soon as he received it, and that under the postal rule of English law he had given his undertaking at the time of his acceptance (5 September), and that the contract should therefore have taken effect on 5 September. But the defendant contended that no contract was formed until the actual reply was received.\nUltimately, the King’ s Bench held that it was due to the defendant\u0026rsquo;s fault that the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s response was late. Thus, when the plaintiff sent the letter of commitment on the evening of 5 September, the contract was formed.\nThe key issue in this case is when the contract was formed. In delivering his judgment, Law J, the judge, held that if the defendant\u0026rsquo;s contention was true, there was zero likelihood that the transaction could have been completed by mail. Because if the offeror is not bound by any of its offer in any way until it receives a letter from the offeree, then similarly the offeree will not be bound until it receives a message that the offeror has received, which will create a long continuance. So, on the contrary. What we need to consider is that from the moment the offeror sends his letter he is all the while always making an offer to the plaintiff until the offeree receives the letter and places his acceptance at his post, the offer is over, and the acceptance takes effect.\nIn dealing with this case the court applied the basic principles of contract law as well as the postal rule. The basic principles of contract law establish the basic framework for the validity of contracts, as well as the timing of the receipt of notices and the question of the parties\u0026rsquo; rights and interests. At the same time this case was the first step in establishing the postal rules of acceptance. It was not until 1892 in Henthorn v. Fraser [1892] 2 Ch 27 that the court established the exact time of acceptance, i.e. the publication of the acceptance letter.\nThe postal rule is an exception to the general rule of contract law in common law countries. It indicates that an offer is accepted when it is communicated. Under the postal rule, the offer or acceptance is effective from the moment the letter is delivered. The post office is only a provider of mailing services. Here the postal rule consists of the following three parts: Firstly, a posted acceptance prevails over a previously posted withdrawal of the offer which had not yet reached the offeree when the acceptance was posted. Secondly, acceptance takes effect on posting even where it never reaches the offeror or only does so after delay. Finally, the contract is taken to have been made at the time of posting so as to take priority over another contract made after the original acceptance was posted.\nThe establishment of postal rules in this way protects the rights of both the offeree and the offeror and ensures the reliability of the transaction taking place. Similar cases such as Byrne \u0026amp; Co v. Leon Van Tien Hoven \u0026amp; Co [1880] 5 CPD 344 are also leading cases in English contract law, dealing mainly with the postal rule in relation to contractual avoidance.\nThe facts were that Van Tien Hoven \u0026amp; Co (the defendants) sent a letter from their Cardiff office to Byrne \u0026amp; Co (the plaintiffs) in New York offering to sell 1,000 boxes of tin plate on 1 October, which letter was received by Bryce \u0026amp; Co on 11 October and the offer was accepted by telegraph on the same day. But as the price of tin plate had risen, on the 8th of October the defendants sent another letter withdrawing their offer.\nAccording to the postal rules we know that the point of time for withdrawing an offer is before the invitation is received by the invited party, and the point of time for the defendants in this case to withdraw their offer was after the invitation had been accepted by the invitee. Also, we can determine the point of time when the acceptance takes effect. Same as in the case of Adams v. Lindsell, once the invited party has sent the notice of acceptance at the moment, this contract has been created. So, for the defendant to make a revocation of the offer here is actually a breach of the contract.\nThe case of Adams v. Lindsell has important significance and far-reaching impact on the development of contract law and social and economic activities. The postal rules established by it clearly define the time point when the contract is established in the activities of offer and acceptance through letters. It makes the offeror and the offeree more clear about the time point when the contract is established, reduces disputes and uncertainties, promotes the smooth conduct of different transactions, and protects the legitimate rights and interests of the offeror and the offeree.\nPostal rules can also adapt well to technological progress today. In the face of the development of communication technology, mail rules are still applicable and have been expanded. Like traditional postal rules, the core of today\u0026rsquo;s postal rules is to establish the time of contract formation. However, the time of contract formation and acceptance is more sensitive than that of traditional ones, because the time required for manual delivery of mail no longer exists, and the efficiency of commercial trade has also been improved. Therefore, in the face of today\u0026rsquo;s electronic information, postal rules support the validity of digital information. By proving the time point when a certain acceptance of an offer is issued, it can be proved that the contract has been formally established. In today\u0026rsquo;s globalized environment, cross-border commercial trade activities are becoming more and more frequent. The existence of postal rules today guarantees the rights and interests of merchants between different countries, clarifies and guarantees the validity of contracts, and prevents misunderstandings and conflicts between the two parties of the transaction due to the time point of receipt and delivery. It helps the court to clarify the time point when the contract is established when facing different communication technologies.\n","permalink":"https://Rchh1125.github.io/personalwork/legalenvironmentofbusiness/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAdams v.

中国是世界茶的发源地，茶伴随着古老的中华民族走过了漫长的历史，见证了中国文化的发展，翻开历史的画卷，几乎每一幅上都可以嗅到茶的清香。陆羽在《茶经》中就早已展示出属于唐代丰富的茶文化。而随着时代的发展，茶不再是只有国人才能品尝到的仙品，各国都掌握了不同的制茶技术，研发出了不同茶与茶食。本文将从其中的茶与茶食一章中体会茶与儒家思想的关系，以及了解茶背后暗示的阶级关系还有不同年代不同地域的人们对茶食的选择的关系。\n一、茶与儒家思想\n“小学放学回家前，先到妈妈办公室，以闽南语向外公问安：‘阿公，我转来啊。’观察外公的玻璃杯，水位太低便要为他添茶，同时要站在卓缘，对外公建树一天发生的事。”“倒茶时，七分水位正确，七分半完美，不得超过八分。倒的过满会被责备，茶都倒不好，那是失家教。”此处展示出了倒茶的规矩，不论是晚辈给前辈倒茶，还是同辈间的相互倒茶亦或是前辈给晚辈倒茶，倒茶的规矩都是一样的。这些都是倒茶的规矩，也是一个人家教，修养的体现。儒家思想一向主张积极入世界，认为茶有助于沟通人际关系，使人与人之之间和谐共处。儒家思想的创始人孔子，一生向往的是“周礼”，他的儒家文化也是追求“礼制”，因此，儒家在关于茶世的活动中无论是饮茶、制茶还是敬茶都讲究一个“礼”。字茶道中的“礼”，是秩序、敬意、仁爱与友谊。“客来敬茶”是中华优良传统美德，晋代“茶汤敬客”的王濛、“茶果宴客”的恒温、“茶果待客”的陆纳，至今被传为佳话。宾客临门，香茗一杯，即表达了以茶会友、续谊谈情的至诚 心情，又表达了对客人的尊敬。\n二、茶背后的阶级关系\n“我观察多劳的凯文，一日要喝到上四到五杯茶。凯文在清晨五点离家，火车通勤一个半钟头至伦敦上工。清晨先饮浓茶才出门，才挨得住天亮前海滨城镇的低温。”“凯文惯喝的茶包是PG Tips，价廉，茶叶碾得极碎，泡出来的茶汤深浓，是英国蓝领极具代表性的品牌”“除了PG Tips,中产阶级最爱的茶品牌，则是Twinings,唐宁茶。其中一位明显例外的人物，即英女皇伊丽莎白二世。皇室管家受访时表示，女皇在早餐时，惯饮唐宁伯爵茶，旅行时也带着茶叶上路。”这里写到伊丽莎白女皇是一位明显例外的选择喝唐宁茶的人，很明显唐宁茶与伊丽莎白的身份地位以及阶级不匹配，也暗示了茶叶的种类与社会阶级的关系。作者在文中对凯文喝的茶叶是这样描写的“凯文的茶色极浓，乍看以为是咖啡。英国的平价茶包大多没有白线和提把，仅用不织布，封住几克碎茶。”凯文为什么会选择喝如此廉价的茶叶，原因我想分为两个：第一是茶叶的价格便宜，作为工人阶级的他的购买力不高，只能选择购买廉价茶叶。第二廉价茶叶会被碾得极碎，所以泡出来的茶汤深浓，这样对于他这种在清晨便出门工作的人可以起到很好的提神作用。所以在英国茶里如果加入的糖愈多，那么愈近劳动阶级。而中产或者上流阶级，则会饮“疲弱，淡如洗碗水”的无糖伯爵茶。在英国人类学家凯特·福克斯的著作《瞧这些英国佬》中就表示从一个人对建筑工人茶避之唯恐不及的情况，可以看见他的阶级焦虑程度。\n在英国，上流阶级的人们会喝下午茶。在19世纪中叶公爵夫人安娜在家中用下午茶招待客人，这一新颖的举动被当时英国的上流阶层的人们所认识并且得到了大家的追捧。经济基础决定上层建筑，上层建筑则对经济基础具有能动的反作用。《傲慢与偏见》中的茶文化场景源自于现实生活，当时正是英国茶文化在社会各个阶层风靡流行的年代，尤其是对于上流社会而言，饮用下午茶是一种身份的象征，同时也是一种重要的社交形式，人们通过各式各样的茶会来展现自我魅力，打造个人品牌，以期巩固固有关系、拓展社交脉络。 对于他们来说，下午茶只不过是他们闲暇时间里打发时间以及彰显地位的一个活动罢了。\n由此可见，喝不同种类的茶以及不同的茶活动，都与人们背后的阶级关系有所联系。对于工人阶级来说，茶对于他们的作用跟咖啡的作用有异曲同工之处，可以帮助他们在一天繁忙的工作中起到提神醒脑的作用。而对于当时的上流阶层的皇室贵族来说，茶是他们用来品尝，用来消磨时间以及宴客的工具之一。但随着茶叶的推广以及世界贸易的不断发展，在当时茶文化背后的阶级暗示已经被逐渐削弱甚至不复存在了。\n三、茶食的时空选择差别\n在不同时代，人们在饮茶时选择的茶食种类有所差别。作者在文中写他们的祖父母辈的选择是这样的——“我的祖父母辈，多在一九三零年代前后出生，至今如果还在，都是八九十岁的人。乳制品在台湾普及，是二战以后的事。因此长辈们儿时的零食原料，是本土农产品。”可见，在作者祖父母辈的年代，由于当时经济贸易的不发达导致了乳制品还有其他零食原料的不普及，所以在当时那个年代的茶食多是本土农产品——花生、芝麻、瓜子……到现在，我们的茶食选择不断的增加，来自全球各地的茶食文化交流不断加深，我们茶食的选择也从单一的本土农产品转变成了玲琅满目的奶制品，我们开始尝试英国的司康饼，法国的磅蛋糕……如今熟悉马卡龙和国王派的人，比熟悉咸梅糕的人多，让我们倍感可惜。面对着各种各样的茶食选择，我们也可以回归本真，体验那批古典的美味茶食，这也是老派台北少女的心意。\n四、总结\n茶文化发源于中国，并且走向世界，其中背后所隐藏的思想，以及社会意义都是独一无二的。如何发掘其背后的思想以及如何让茶文化在当今的社会环境下被更深地发掘，更好地发挥，正是我们应当努力的。我们也应当与《老派少女的购物路线》中的作者洪爱珠一样，能够细心地感受老派的魅力，在繁忙的都市生活中可以闹中取静，感受茶食文化中的深刻意象。\n","permalink":"https://Rchh1125.github.io/personalwork/readingreport/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e体会《老派少女的购物路线》中的茶文化\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e摘要\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e作者洪爱珠本是一名平面工作者，在她的母亲逝世后，她将自己的思念寄托于文字，从小厨房到菜市场，从粥粉面饭到异乡茶饭，记录了属于她们几代台湾人的老派少女的购物路线。\n中国是世界茶的发源地，茶伴随着古老的中华民族走过了漫长的历史，见证了中国文化的发展，翻开历史的画卷，几乎每一幅上都可以嗅到茶的清香。陆羽在《茶经》中就早已展示出属于唐代丰富的茶文化。而随着时代的发展，茶不再是只有国人才能品尝到的仙品，各国都掌握了不同的制茶技术，研发出了不同茶与茶食。本文将从其中的茶与茶食一章中体会茶与儒家思想的关系，以及了解茶背后暗示的阶级关系还有不同年代不同地域的人们对茶食的选择的关系。\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e一、茶与儒家思想\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“小学放学回家前，先到妈妈办公室，以闽南语向外公问安：‘阿公，我转来啊。’观察外公的玻璃杯，水位太低便要为他添茶，同时要站在卓缘，对外公建树一天发生的事。”“倒茶时，七分水位正确，七分半完美，不得超过八分。倒的过满会被责备，茶都倒不好，那是失家教。”此处展示出了倒茶的规矩，不论是晚辈给前辈倒茶，还是同辈间的相互倒茶亦或是前辈给晚辈倒茶，倒茶的规矩都是一样的。这些都是倒茶的规矩，也是一个人家教，修养的体现。儒家思想一向主张积极入世界，认为茶有助于沟通人际关系，使人与人之之间和谐共处。儒家思想的创始人孔子，一生向往的是“周礼”，他的儒家文化也是追求“礼制”，因此，儒家在关于茶世的活动中无论是饮茶、制茶还是敬茶都讲究一个“礼”。字茶道中的“礼”，是秩序、敬意、仁爱与友谊。“客来敬茶”是中华优良传统美德，晋代“茶汤敬客”的王濛、“茶果宴客”的恒温、“茶果待客”的陆纳，至今被传为佳话。宾客临门，香茗一杯，即表达了以茶会友、续谊谈情的至诚

对于他们来说，下午茶只不过是他们闲暇时间里打发时间以及彰显地位的一个活动罢了。\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e由此可见，喝不同种类的茶以及不同的茶活动，都与人们背后的阶级关系有所联系。对于工人阶级来说，茶对于他们的作用跟咖啡的作用有异曲同工之处，可以帮助他们在一天繁忙的工作中起到提神醒脑的作用。而对于当时的上流阶层的皇室贵族来说，茶是他们用来品尝，用来消磨时间以及宴客的工具之一。但随着茶叶的推广以及世界贸易的不断发展，在当时茶文化背后的阶级暗示已经被逐渐削弱甚至不复存在了。\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e三、茶食的时空选择差别\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e在不同时代，人们在饮茶时选择的茶食种类有所差别。作者在文中写他们的祖父母辈的选择是这样的——“我的祖父母辈，多在一九三零年代前后出生，至今如果还在，都是八九十岁的人。乳制品在台湾普及，是二战以后的事。因此长辈们儿时的零食原料，是本土农产品。”可见，在作者祖父母辈的年代，由于当时经济贸易的不发达导致了乳制品还有其他零食原料的不普及，所以在当时那个年代的茶食多是本土农产品——花生、芝麻、瓜子……到现在，我们的茶食选择不断的增加，来自全球各地的茶食文化交流不断加深，我们茶食的选择也从单一的本土农产品转变成了玲琅满目的奶制品，我们开始尝试英国的司康饼，法国的磅蛋糕……如今熟悉马卡龙和国王派的人，比熟悉咸梅糕的人多，让我们倍感可惜。面对着各种各样的茶食选择，我们也可以回归本真，体验那批古典的美味茶食，这也是老派台北少女的心意。\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e四、总结\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e茶文化发源于中国，并且走向世界，其中背后所隐藏的思想，以及社会意义都是独一无二的。如何发掘其背后的思想以及如何让茶文化在当今的社会环境下被更深地发掘，更好地发挥，正是我们应当努力的。我们也应当与《老派少女的购物路线》中的作者洪爱珠一样，能够细心地感受老派的魅力，在繁忙的都市生活中可以闹中取静，感受茶食文化中的深刻意象。\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Reading
