Adams v. Lindsell

King’s Bench
1B & Ald 681 (1818)

In this case the plaintiff Adams was an English wool manufacturer, and the defendant Lindsell was a German wool distributor. The background to the controversy in the case was that on 2 September 1817 the defendant Lindsell made an offer by letter to sell a certain quantity of wool to the plaintiff Adams and specified that the plaintiff was required to give him an answer by post. But the letter did not reach the plaintiff in time, owing to the defendant's wrong address. The plaintiff received the letter on the 5th of September and on the same day undertook the offer and sent the letter back, and on the 9th of September the defendant received the letter, but he had already sold the wool to a third party on the 8th of September.

On this point the plaintiff and the defendant held different propositions. Adams, the plaintiff, contended that he had accepted the offer as soon as he received it, and that under the postal rule of English law he had given his undertaking at the time of his acceptance (5 September), and that the contract should therefore have taken effect on 5 September. But the defendant contended that no contract was formed until the actual reply was received.

Ultimately, the King’ s Bench held that it was due to the defendant's fault that the plaintiff's response was late. Thus, when the plaintiff sent the letter of commitment on the evening of 5 September, the contract was formed.

The key issue in this case is when the contract was formed. In delivering his judgment, Law J, the judge, held that if the defendant's contention was true, there was zero likelihood that the transaction could have been completed by mail. Because if the offeror is not bound by any of its offer in any way until it receives a letter from the offeree, then similarly the offeree will not be bound until it receives a message that the offeror has received, which will create a long continuance. So, on the contrary. What we need to consider is that from the moment the offeror sends his letter he is all the while always making an offer to the plaintiff until the offeree receives the letter and places his acceptance at his post, the offer is over, and the acceptance takes effect.

In dealing with this case the court applied the basic principles of contract law as well as the postal rule. The basic principles of contract law establish the basic framework for the validity of contracts, as well as the timing of the receipt of notices and the question of the parties' rights and interests. At the same time this case was the first step in establishing the postal rules of acceptance. It was not until 1892 in Henthorn v. Fraser [1892] 2 Ch 27 that the court established the exact time of acceptance, i.e. the publication of the acceptance letter.

The postal rule is an exception to the general rule of contract law in common law countries. It indicates that an offer is accepted when it is communicated. Under the postal rule, the offer or acceptance is effective from the moment the letter is delivered. The post office is only a provider of mailing services. Here the postal rule consists of the following three parts: Firstly, a posted acceptance prevails over a previously posted withdrawal of the offer which had not yet reached the offeree when the acceptance was posted. Secondly, acceptance takes effect on posting even where it never reaches the offeror or only does so after delay. Finally, the contract is taken to have been made at the time of posting so as to take priority over another contract made after the original acceptance was posted.

The establishment of postal rules in this way protects the rights of both the offeree and the offeror and ensures the reliability of the transaction taking place.
Similar cases such as Byrne & Co v. Leon Van Tien Hoven & Co [1880] 5 CPD 344 are also leading cases in English contract law, dealing mainly with the postal rule in relation to contractual avoidance. 

The facts were that Van Tien Hoven & Co (the defendants) sent a letter from their Cardiff office to Byrne & Co (the plaintiffs) in New York offering to sell 1,000 boxes of tin plate on 1 October, which letter was received by Bryce & Co on 11 October and the offer was accepted by telegraph on the same day. But as the price of tin plate had risen, on the 8th of October the defendants sent another letter withdrawing their offer.

According to the postal rules we know that the point of time for withdrawing an offer is before the invitation is received by the invited party, and the point of time for the defendants in this case to withdraw their offer was after the invitation had been accepted by the invitee. Also, we can determine the point of time when the acceptance takes effect. Same as in the case of Adams v. Lindsell, once the invited party has sent the notice of acceptance at the moment, this contract has been created. So, for the defendant to make a revocation of the offer here is actually a breach of the contract.

The case of Adams v. Lindsell has important significance and far-reaching impact on the development of contract law and social and economic activities. The postal rules established by it clearly define the time point when the contract is established in the activities of offer and acceptance through letters. It makes the offeror and the offeree more clear about the time point when the contract is established, reduces disputes and uncertainties, promotes the smooth conduct of different transactions, and protects the legitimate rights and interests of the offeror and the offeree.

Postal rules can also adapt well to technological progress today. In the face of the development of communication technology, mail rules are still applicable and have been expanded. Like traditional postal rules, the core of today's postal rules is to establish the time of contract formation. However, the time of contract formation and acceptance is more sensitive than that of traditional ones, because the time required for manual delivery of mail no longer exists, and the efficiency of commercial trade has also been improved. Therefore, in the face of today's electronic information, postal rules support the validity of digital information. By proving the time point when a certain acceptance of an offer is issued, it can be proved that the contract has been formally established. In today's globalized environment, cross-border commercial trade activities are becoming more and more frequent. The existence of postal rules today guarantees the rights and interests of merchants between different countries, clarifies and guarantees the validity of contracts, and prevents misunderstandings and conflicts between the two parties of the transaction due to the time point of receipt and delivery. It helps the court to clarify the time point when the contract is established when facing different communication technologies.
