 Sinece i am afraid of heights, I seldom fly in the old days✈️, but I heared  a saying that the brave first enjoy the world, so I intend to travel to some countries even if it takes a long time to fly, to enjoy the beauty of the world!🌍🗽🗼🗿🗺️🏰🏯🏟️

 The frist place I want to visit is Iceland🇮🇸.It is located in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean🌊, very close to the Arctic Circle, where I could see the Aurora and go out to the sea to watch whales🐳 and so on, and I think it is a place full of surprises!


I would very much like to go to Yunnan🌳⛰️, it's a very relaxing place and I would like to take up the challenge of hiking in Yunnan🥾, I bet that would be a very fun & exciting trip as well.🏕️
